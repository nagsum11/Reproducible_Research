This is an R Markdown document. This is created for Assignment 1 of Reproducible Research course.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/shash/Documents/repdata_data_activity")

data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

summary(data)
```

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Below calculates total number of stepds taken per day
sum_steps <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(data$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

names(sum_steps) <- c("date", "steps")

#Below is to create Histogram for Total Steps per day.
hist(sum_steps$steps, main="Histogram for Total Steps per Day", xlab="Total Steps", col="lightgreen")

# Mean of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(sum_steps$steps)

#Median of the total number of steps taken per day
median(sum_steps$steps)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean_data <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(data$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
names(mean_data) <- c("interval", "mean")

#1.Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

plot(mean_data$interval, 
     mean_data$mean, 
     type="l", 
     col="Red", 
     lwd=2, 
     xlab="Interval [minutes]", 
     ylab="Average number of steps", 
     main="Time-series for Avg number of steps per intervals")

```

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean_data[which(mean_data$mean == max(mean_data$mean)) ,1]

```

## Imputing missing values

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(data))

# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
# Find the position of NA

pos <- which(is.na(data$steps))

#Create Vector containing Mean Value. I am taking Mean values for imputing the mission Numbers.

vector <- rep(mean(data$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times=length(pos))

# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
# Replace  NA Value by Median value
data[pos, "steps"] <-vector


```

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r, echo=TRUE}

sum_steps <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(data$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

names(sum_steps) <- c("date", "steps")

hist(sum_steps$steps, main="Histogram for Total Steps per Day", xlab="Total Steps", col="Blue")

mean(sum_steps$steps)

median(sum_steps$steps)
```

## What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
After imputting the missing data the mean and median values changed. Number of data increased and caused the increased value in Mean and Median Value.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Tell R that Date column is in specified Date format
data$date <- as.POSIXct(data$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
weekday=tolower(weekdays(data$date))
data_tmp <- cbind( data, weekday)

#Create the Day Type Variable
type=ifelse(data_tmp$weekday == "saturday" | data_tmp$weekday == "sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
data_new <- cbind( data_tmp, type)

mean_data <- aggregate(data_new$steps, by=list(data_new$type, data_new$weekday, data_new$interval), mean)

# Name the attributes
names(mean_data) <- c("daytype", "weekday", "interval", "mean")

library(lattice)

# 2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

xyplot(mean~ mean_data$interval | mean_data$daytype, 
     mean_data, 
     type="l", 
     col="Red", 
     lwd=2, 
     xlab="Interval [minutes]", 
     ylab="Average number of steps", 
     main="Time-series for Avg number of steps per intervals")
```
